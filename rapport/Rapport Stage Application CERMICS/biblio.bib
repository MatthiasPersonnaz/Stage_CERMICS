	title = {Error estimation for linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems arising from electronic structure calculation},
	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01689793},
	abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to provide error bounds for linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems arising from electronic structure calculation. We focus on ground-state calculations based on Density Functional Theory, including Kohn-Sham models. Our bounds mostly rely on a posteriori error analysis. More precisely, we start by studying a phenomenon of discretization error cancellation for a simple linear eigenvalue problem, for which analytical solutions are available. The mathematical study is based on an a priori analysis for the energy error. Then, we present an a posteriori analysis for the Laplace eigenvalue problem discretized with finite elements. For simple eigenvalues of the Laplace operator and their corresponding eigenvectors , we provide guaranteed, fully computable and efficient error bounds. Thereafter, we focus on nonlinear eigenvalue problems. First, we provide an a posteriori analysis for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The error bounds are valid under assumptions that can be numerically checked, and can be separated in two components coming respectively from the discretization and the iterative algorithm used to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Balancing these error components allows to optimize the computational resources. Second, we present a post-processing method for the Kohn-Sham problem, which improves the accuracy of planewave computations of ground state orbitals at a low computational cost. The post-processed solutions can be used either as a more precise solution of the problem, or used for computing an estimation of the discretization error. This estimation is not guaranteed, but in practice close to the real error.},

	abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr’s ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli’s exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.},
